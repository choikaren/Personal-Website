          Eyes to see, nose to smell, mouth to taste. But <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span> is it that when
          we add the color of our skin to the equation, we get treated differently?
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          In New York City, historically, Black Americans have lower high school graduation rates, lower employment
          rates, lower earnings, and an increase in the number of women who become single mothers. This isn’t something
          new, and to understand why, we have to start in the beginning.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          Right after the civil war, equality wasn’t granted immediately. The South had Jim Crow laws and the North
          still barred african americans to a life whites had. Without $250 of property, blacks were denied the right to
          vote. The lingering legacy of slavery and the idea that African Americans were inferior led them to be
          incarcerated at alarming rates. They undeniably underwent more scrutiny than their white counterparts.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          New York City quickly became segregated. Despite the city being diverse overflowing with immigrants,
          it was divided within. In fact, the city still had close ties to the South. They continued pouring in money to
          plantation investments. As this continued, so did the growing anti-Black sentiment. Whites and racial groups
          lived in different districts clearly drawn on maps. It was testament to the inequality and further reinforced
          the notion of white superiority, and Black inferiority.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          Taking a closer look, schools mainly occupied by black students received fewer resources, fewer funding.
          Equipped with less teachers, many of whom had little experience, the staff wasn’t adequately trained to
          provide equal education. Despite the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling in favor of desegregation,
          reforms still weren’t made to level the playing field for Black and Latino students. In fact, the large
          performance gap wasn’t reduced, and the aftermath of the court case only added to demonstrate how racial and
          income differences allowed for different treatment. And, this divide didn’t pertain just to education. This
          imbalance was visible in inadequate affordable housing, greater unjust enforcement of law towards Black
          people, and even higher unemployment rates.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          As the racial hierarchy from the South migrated over to New York City, Blacks were considered racially
          inferior. Blacks were no longer hired, and instead replaced by the influx of German and Irish
          immigrants during the 20th century.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          Most notably though, the white dominated police forces were untrained. In fact, they weren’t known to quell
          crimes, but rather responded to disorder. According to Gary Potter, a criminologist, officers were hired to
          control a ‘dangerous underclass’ - consisting of African Americans, immigrants, and the poor. Blacks
          were increasing vulnerable to police corruption and violence. Even with no wrongdoing, they were predetermined
          to have commited a crime by the city police force. Ultimately, this meant higher incarceration rates, building
          the image that they were dangerous and reinforced that they needed to be locked up.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          Things did start looking brighter as David Dinkins was elected mayor though. He introduced ‘communal
          policing’, instructing officers to get to know residents and listen to concerns, building trust.
          However, it didn’t last long as he was succeeded by Rudolph Giuliani who appointed William Bratton as police
          commissioner. He lobbied for “Broken Windows” policing, which focused on arresting people for small crimes, in
          hopes of reducing the chance of more serious crimes.

        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          This method transpired into what we know today as Stop and Frisk. What makes it so dangerous is that
          they mark being Black a crime, and it gives police the privilege to interrogate and take further necessary
          action. Even then, with excessive power and force, when police do commit wrong, no legal action or criminal
          charges are brought against the officers. This places them upon a pedestal, allowing them to be racist with no
          repercussions.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          With the development of real estate in the city heavily supported by Michael Bloomberg, this ramped up
          gentrification in New York City. Gentrification further solidified the divide of districts between white and
          people of color, ultimately strengthening the bias the city had and still currently does. Where African
          Americans most commonly reside in the city almost exactly overlaps with where poverty, greater needs and
          funding reside.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          However, there have been many strides that have been made as well.
          From the start, Bloomberg set out to form alliances across both race and party lines. Within two months of
          taking office, he had met with all the city's Black and Latino leaders.
          He worked hard to improve the school system for students of color, and sought to increase high school
          graduation rates among minorities. By the time he left office, graduation rates for Blacks and Latinos had
          increased approximately twenty percent. Bloomberg worked hard to avoid racial polarization when high-profile
          incidents arose. When mistakes were made,
          he accepted responsibility for others actions.
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio-item-description-sub">
          Despite this, it wasn’t until DeBlasio’s current term that reduced the rate of stop and frisk. And even then,
          we have a long way to go, as evidenced by the recent protests against police brutality.
          Ultimately, it is difficult to revert a system of segregation carved into our society, and so, it’s up to us
          to put pressure on the government to create change.
